# MatlabNeuralNetwork
Description: A very simple and basic Neural Network Toolbox for Matlab. Read and run NNdemo.m for an idea of how to use it.

I created this in order to understand neural networks better. It's very basic, in the sense that it has nothing fancy at all and only has basic functions: ConstructNN, RunNN, TrainNN.

ConstructNN creates an object (which is the neural network) and has the matrices which keeps track of stuff.

RunNN just runs the neural network with the arguments you give it.

TrainNN does a backpropagation ONCE through all the data you give it (so each time you run it is one epoch).
